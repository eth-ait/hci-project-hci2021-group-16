# CO2 Compensation Visualization, Group 16
#### Mert Çökmez, Vikram Thanigaivelan, Raffael Kunz, George Selim, Yi-Tau Ly, (Leon Thomm)

## Project description

Our goal is to visualize and motivate CO2-compensation for users. Greenhouse gas effect has been a rising topic the last decade and remains important. Examples for activities that result in CO2 emission include but are not restricted to commuting, machine learning, streaming, shopping, etc. By visualizing the user's contribution to CO2-compensation, we wish to help them understand and grasp their impact and possibilities they have.

## Ideation

Summarizing our desktop research, there are a lot of online services that calculate the user's CO2 emission and/or enables the user to compensate for their carbon footprint throught the service. The visualization of the compensation is often showed as charts, certificates or checkmarks at the check-out process (e.g. Zalando or Flixbus). Often, CO2 compensation is offered by planting trees or investing into climate sustainable projects on the behalf of the user.
