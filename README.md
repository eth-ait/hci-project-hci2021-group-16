# CO2 Compensation Visualization, Group 16
#### Mert Çökmez, Vikram Thanigaivelan, Raffael Kunz, George Selim, Yi-Tau Ly, (Leon Thomm)

## Project description

Our goal is to visualize and motivate CO2-compensation for users. Greenhouse gas effect has been a rising topic the last decade and remains important. Examples for activities that result in CO2 emission include but are not restricted to commuting, machine learning, streaming, shopping, etc. By visualizing the user's contribution to CO2-compensation, we wish to help them understand and grasp their impact and possibilities they have.

## Ideation

Summarizing our desktop research, there are a lot of online services that calculate the user's CO2 emission and/or enable the user to compensate for their carbon footprint through the service. Often, CO2 compensation is offered by planting trees or investing into climate sustainable projects on the behalf of the user. An example for real-time CO2 emission visualization is given on QUARTZ. It shows how many trees’ CO2 neutralizing capabilities the user has „used up“ since he or she has opened the Google webpage. On the other hand, the visualization of CO2 compensation is frequently shown as charts, certificates or checkmarks at the check-out process (e.g. Zalando or Flixbus). The current state of CO2 compensation visualization with numbers, charts and certificates does not satisfy us, because it is still hard for the user to grasp their impact through emission and compensation.
<br>Key points of our project are to visualize pollution and compensation. For example, an 8-bit tree or forest as a web-extention could represent the user’s current net CO2 emission or it could simply just flourish as you contribute to CO2 compensation projects and wither as you forget or have not contributed to such projects for a longer time. An easier way of visualizing CO2 compensation could be rendering a graph with the user’s CO2 emission and compensations over time or use a scale with an emission and a compensation side.
<br>Moreover, through our visualizations, we hope to motivate the user to compensate for the CO2 emissions they cause. This could be given in the form of social recognition through social media sharing posts or NFT plant tokens that you can collect and lose. More motivation could be triggered through rankings, either single or team based.  Also, we think that it is important to show or visualize the concrete results of the CO2 compensated.
    
## Evaluation

## Low-fidelity Prototype

A: Forest Browser Extension
Web-extension forest grows as CO2 is compensated and shrinks/dies if the user emits too much CO2 or does not contribute to CO2 emission compensation. If the user does not compensate for CO2 emission for a month, a push notification will be sent.
We tried to keep the prototype as simple as possible whilst keeping key features. The web-extension shall be a calm guard of the user‘s CO2 compensations, keep him/her happy as long as the forest is taken care of, and alert the user when CO2 emissions are too high in relation to the compensations. We opted to use simplistic 8-bit caricatures and visualized them as a 2D-prototype.

B: CO2-Buster
This tool should be used by webshops or online booking websites to offer an interactive way of CO2-compensation, instead of the usual check mark we see on most websites today.
The CO2-Buster let’s you choose your desired amount of CO2 to compensate by a slider, ranging from 0% to over 100% of your emissions caused by your purchase. This offers you the option to help other buyers, who can not afford the compensation or didn’t bother to.
The design is focussed on a positive and encouraging user experience, animating the Emissions as a cloud and then sucking up the part of the cloud you compensated for in a satisfying animation and finally congratulating you, for your effort against climate change, but never judging you for choosing less than 100%.
The costs will then just be added on top of your bill, based on percentage chosen and thus the respective amount of CO2 to compensate, simple and easy.
The focus of this prototype is really on simplicity of use and positive user experience. All one has to do is slide a slider to the desired position, representing the amount to compensate.

C: Compensation Credits
The idea is here is a universal reward system, where all the user’s CO2 compensation is exchanged to tokens. Users have to make an account, where they will store their tokens. 
Our service offers many ways to redeem those tokens, as we have a store and many partnerships that offer our users discounts on products, the possibility to do more CO2 compensation(use the tokens to plant more trees) as well as a social media sharing possibility.  Paper prototyping made us reflect on the amount of info we want to add when offering a green buying choice, it also made us reflect how to present the options in terms of colors and extra steps that the user has to make before checking out.
