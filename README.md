# CO2 Compensation Visualization, Group 16
#### Mert Çökmez, Vikram Thanigaivelan, Raffael Kunz, George Selim, Yi-Tau Ly, (Leon Thomm)

## Project description

Our goal is to visualize and motivate CO2-compensation for users. Greenhouse gas effect has been a rising topic the last decade and remains important. Examples for activities that result in CO2 emission include but are not restricted to commuting, machine learning, streaming, shopping, etc. By visualizing the user's contribution to CO2-compensation, we wish to help them understand and grasp their impact and possibilities they have.

## Ideation

Summarizing our desktop research, there are a lot of online services that calculate the user's CO2 emission and/or enables the user to compensate for their carbon footprint throught the service. The visualization of the compensation is often showed as charts, certificates or checkmarks at the check-out process (e.g. Zalando or Flixbus). Often, CO2 compensation is offered by planting trees or investing into climate sustainable projects on the behalf of the user.
<\br>Key points of our project are to visualize pollution and compensation. For example, an 8-bit tree or forest as a web-extention could represent the user’s current net CO2 emission or it could simply just flourish as you contribute to CO2 compensation projects and wither as you forget or have not contributed to such projects for a longer time. An easier way of visualizing CO2 compensation could be rendering a graph with the user’s CO2 emission and compensations over time or use a scale with an emission and a compensation side.
<\br>Moreover, through our visualizations, we hope to motivate the user to compensate for the CO2 emissions they cause. This could be given in the form of social recognition through social media sharing post or NFT plant tokens that you can collect and lose. More motivation could be triggered through rankings, either single or team based.  Also, we think that it is important to show or visualize the concrete results of the CO2 compensated.
